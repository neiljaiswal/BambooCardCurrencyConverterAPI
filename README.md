**# BambooCard Currency Converter API**

This is a currency converter API built using ASP.NET Core. It uses the Frankfurter API to provide exchange rates and allows for currency conversions.

**## Requirements**

- .NET 8 SDK or later

**## How to Run**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/neiljaiswal/BambooCardCurrencyConverterAPI.git

cd CurrencyConverterAPI

dotnet restore

dotnet run


**Endpoints**

GET /api/currencyconverter/latest?baseCurrency=EUR
Retrieves the latest exchange rates for a specific base currency.

POST /api/currencyconverter/convert
Converts amounts between different currencies. Excludes TRY, PLN, THB, and MXN.

POST /api/currencyconverter/historical
Returns a set of historical rates for a given period using pagination based on a specific base currency.

**Assumptions**

The Frankfurter API may occasionally fail to respond on the first request, so the implementation includes retry logic.
The API handles pagination for historical rates to manage large data sets efficiently.
